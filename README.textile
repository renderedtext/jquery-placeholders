h1. jquery-placeholders

jQuery plugin for input hints which uses your placeholder HTML5 attributes, so you can write markup for modern browsers first and degrade gracefully.

h2. Example

<pre><code>$("#someForm").placeholders(["#name", "#email"]);</code></pre>

This would load placeholder text from the placeholder attribute, and prevent the placeholder text from being submitted.

See @demo.html@ for a full example.
